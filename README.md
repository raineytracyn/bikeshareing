# bikeshareing

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
## The purpose of the analysis is:
### To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results:
While using the Tableau tool, I was able to produce varying perspectives on the data provided. Some information captured from the images below will show you Males are the predomnent user of bicycles, and are heavily utilized during the hours of of 0600-0900 and 1600-1900.

# With this information, you can not only suceed in a bike sharing company, but you can expand the business into hydration centers since there is a faily large portion of the elderly community that bike.

# Take a look at the story here:

# In summary, 
## you can see where elderly male and female bicycles who have 1-2 hour ride durations are at. In addition to setting up bicycle stations, it would be easy to set up gender-related "hydration centers" along the routes. What a better way to demonstrate support for safe riding, but also reduce what a rider would need to carry for a such a long ride!
